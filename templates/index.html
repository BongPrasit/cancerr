        <h2>About Breast Cancer and Prediction Model</h2>
        <p>
            Breast cancer is a dangerous disease that occurs when cells in the breast grow uncontrollably. It can spread to other parts of the body and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving survival rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our cancer prediction model was created to assist in the early detection of breast cancer by analyzing specific features from medical data. This model helps in identifying potential cases of cancer more efficiently, enabling timely medical intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The importance of this model lies in its ability to provide quick and accurate predictions, which can significantly aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating breast cancer. The model was developed using various machine learning algorithms, and we tested their performance to select the one with the highest accuracy for the best results.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure the highest level of accuracy, we evaluated different algorithms and chose the one that performed best based on the accuracy metrics. This rigorous testing process helps in delivering reliable and precise predictions.
